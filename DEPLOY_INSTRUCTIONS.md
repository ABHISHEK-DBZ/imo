# Start Deployment

## 1. GitHub
I have locally committed your code.
Run these commands in your separate terminal (or VS Code):
```bash
# Create a new repository on github.com
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sambhav-ai.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Vercel (Recommended)
Deployment is easiest with Vercel.
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Select your GitHub repo
3. Click **Deploy**

That's it!
