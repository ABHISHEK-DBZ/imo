## 🌟 Vision
**SAMBHAV** (Possibility) is a next-generation communication bridge designed for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. Unlike traditional tools that simply translate words, SAMBHAV understands **Context**, **Emotion**, and **Urgency**.

We don't just translate signs; we translate *intent*.
